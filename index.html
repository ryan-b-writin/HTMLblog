  <h3>My five favorite video game consoles, in no particular order:</h3>

      <h1>Super Nintendo</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>You don't title a post like this and not put the Super Nintendo
     <br>at the top. Even if you aren't ranking them, even if you're
     <br>only showing the post to classmates. Someone on the internet will 
     <br>KNOW, immediately, and they will find you. 
     <br>
     <br>The Super Nintendo represents one of video games' most iconic and
     <br>well-known game producers at the peak of their power. Not only
     <br>were its' games leaps and bounds ahead of the competition
     <br>technologically, but many were so well-made that they're still fun
     <br>to play to this day.

      <h1>Nintendo 3DS</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>The Nintendo 3DS is Nintendo's latest and greatest handheld console.
     <br>Nintendo handhelds trace a fine lineage alllll the way back to the
     <br>OG "brick" Game Boy. The 3DS being the most powerful of these, it's
     <br>no surprise that it boasts some of Nintendo's very best games period. 
     <br>In addition, a wifi antenna makes online play possible- which is great
     <br>if you write blogs about your favorite game consoles but never have
     <br>anyone to play with!</p>

      <h1>Sega Genesis</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>Here's a bit of my own personal bias showing through. The Genesis
     <br>was the first game console I owned. Cliche as it sounds, I
     <br>mowed lawns for a whole summer to save up. The commercials for
     <br>Sonic the Hedgehog got to me, and their message still has hold
     <br>of me to this day: "Look how cool games are!!"
     <br>
     <br>Despite being noticeably weaker than its direct competition, the
     <br>Super Nintendo, the thing you can say about the Genesis is that it
     <br>had <em>style</em>. Its games had an edgier look and feel, complete with grinding
     <br>guitar soundtracks to play them to- though I should point out that the 
     <br>tech wasn't really there yet, and the 'guitars' usually sounded like alarm
     <br>clocks being ground up.

      <h1>Sony Playstation 2</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>Sony entered the console market with the Playstation and it, like the 
     <br>Super Nintendo before it, established Sony as the big power player 
     <br>for a generation. The Playstation 2 followed and built on Sony's
     <br>lead, despite strong competition. Sony made a handful of great titles 
     <br>in-house, but what made the Playstations stand out was the enormous
     <br>selection of third-party titles available. 
     <br>
     <br>The Playstation 2 will also play Playstation 1 games, so no need to choose
     <br>between them!

      <h1>Microsoft Xbox 360</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 were the big players in the
     <br>previous generation, and I give the edge to the 360- just barely- because
     <br>it has a sliiightly larger library of titles. Most of the big games
     <br>came out on both platforms, and there's plenty to recommend the PS3 as well.
