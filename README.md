# Personal blog page

## Instructions

Build a basic blog page that has 5 articles and any random topics you want to talk about. The text can be anything, even placeholder text ( look at this [lorem ipsum text generator](http://lorem-ipsum.perbang.dk/) for an example of the official unofficial gibberish of web developers everywhere ).

1. There should be a page header containing the blog's title.
1. There should be a page footer containing the copyright notice. View pretty much any web site to see an example.
1. Each article has a header containing a title.
1. Each article has a footer containing the author and publication date.
1. Each article has at least one section.
